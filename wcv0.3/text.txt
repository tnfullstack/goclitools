“The count function uses the NewScanner function from the bufio package to create a new scanner. 
A scanner is a convenient way of reading data delimited by spaces or new lines. By default, 
a scanner reads lines of data, so we instruct the scanner to read words instead by setting the 
Split function of the scanner to bufio.ScanWords. We then define a variable, wc, 
to hold the word count and increment it by looping through each token using the scanner.Scan 
function and adding 1 to the counter each time. We then return the word count.
In this example, for simplicity’s sake, we are ignoring the error that may be generated during 
the scanning. In your code, always check for errors. You’ll learn more about dealing with 
errors in the context of a command-line tool ”
